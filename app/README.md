# Fundly Style Guide

This repo builds the Fundly base CSS and is a living documentation describing each of the styles.

These styles are following a declarative principle whereby CSS on the client side is done purely through the application of specific class that represent the styles needed for a particular component.

The aim is to never need to write CSS on the front-end outside of updates to this repo.
